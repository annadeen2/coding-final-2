      <h1>How Are Americans Using Their Stimulus Checks?</h1>

      </div>

      <h3> The Second </h3>
      <p>After the first round of payments, it became clear that people who are non-white, without a college degree and in lower-income households that have had financial setbacks because of the pandemic, are more likely to use a huge chunk their
        payments to pay down debts. The poll, done by SurveyMonkey, also showed that their counterparts, on the other hand, are more likely to save most of their payments. People of color are also more likely to spend a larger portion of their
        stimulus than white people. </p>
